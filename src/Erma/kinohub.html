        Yermakhan Malikuly Khamitov was born on September 1, 2007, in the city of Semey, Republic of Kazakhstan. As the second child and the first son in his family, he showed an early interest in the arts, particularly cinema, which led him to pursue a career in acting.

He showed his versatility in the teen comedy "Project X" and surprised fans with a memorable role in the epic superhero film "Justice League."
